## About Zooniverse

Zooniverse is a citizen science web portal owned and operated by the Citizen Science Alliance. It is home to some of the Internet's largest, most popular and most successful citizen science projects. The organization grew from the original Galaxy Zoo project and now hosts dozens of projects which allow volunteers to participate in crowdsourced scientific research. It has headquarters at Oxford University and the Adler Planetarium. Unlike many early internet-based citizen science projects (such as SETI@home) which used spare computer processing power to analyse data, known as volunteer computing, Zooniverse projects require the active participation of human volunteers to complete research tasks. Projects have been drawn from disciplines including astronomy, ecology, cell biology, humanities, and climate science.

## My Profile

Most of my contributions as a citizen scientist involve astronomy. Currently I participate in several projects, you can follow me through the link of my public profile on the platform. Here is my profile on Zooniverse Plataform: https://www.zooniverse.org/users/vlemos. Below you can find some of my contributions to each project on Zooniverse. I try to update this list weekly:

| ProjectName | Organization | Description | Classifications | Comments | 
|  ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | 
| Active Asteroids | NASA | Examine images to find comet-like tails on asteroids! These strange objects hold clues about water on Earth, in the solar system, and beyond. | 2754 |  |
| Gravity Spy | California State University Fullerton and Others | Help scientists at LIGO search for gravitational waves, the elusive ripples of spacetime. | 386 |  |
| SuperWASP: Black Hole Hunters | ESCAPE | Many astronomers believe that the Milky Way is teeming with black holes, but so far we have only found a handful. In this project you will search for tell-tale signals that may reveal the hidden black holes in our galaxy. | 57 |  |
| Planet Hunters Tess | Oxford | The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is providing us with a huge amount of data that lets us look for planets outside of our own Solar System, including planets that could support life. | 28 |  |
| Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 | NASA | Weâ€™re looking for this planet and for new brown dwarfs in the backyard of the solar system using data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. | 27 |  |
| Planet Hunters NGTS | NGTS | The Next-Generation Transit Survey have been searching for transiting exoplanets around the brightest stars in the sky.| 6 |  |
| Supernova Hunters | University of Minnesota and others | Supernova Hunters is led by astrophysicist Darryl Wright, formerly of the University of Minnesota and now at the Mayo Clinic, and Kenneth Smith of Queens University Belfast. The full team includes our volunteer participants, many of whom have seen more supernovae images than most professional astrophysicists. | 4 | Contribution as a citizen scientist to the discovery of AT 2022vgh, best described at https://supernovahunters.github.io/discoveries/2022/10/01/october-discoveries.html |
